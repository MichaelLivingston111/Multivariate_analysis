Different techniques for dealing with multiple variables in large data sets.

One such example is Principal compnent analysis - a tool useful for examining relationships among different 'groups' in large data sets. I have frequently utilized this method in my research to identify patterns in data sets. It is particularly useful in dataset with a large number of variables, as PCA is a dimensonailty reduction technique. This allows for the analysis of trends between many different variables at once.
